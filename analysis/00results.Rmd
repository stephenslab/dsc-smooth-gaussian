Let's take a look at the DSC results using an interactive Shiny plot:

```{r}
library(dscr)
library(dscrutils)
dscout <- dscquery(dsc.outdir = "../settings",
                   targets    = c("simulate.scenario","analyze","score.error","simulate.pve"))
dscr::shiny_plot(dscout %>% dplyr::filter(simulate.pve==0.5),"simulate.scenario","analyze")
dscr::shiny_plot(dscout %>% dplyr::filter(simulate.pve==0.95),"simulate.scenario","analyze")
```

current summary: smash is better except in low-noise setting.
